# Work-Day-Scheduler
this is a workday scheduler made using bootstrap,css,font awesome,jquery and moment.js

I had a lot of help from classmates and tutorials. I plan to revisit this project and see where I could have put my own spin on the scheduler.

I understand the components and the basic necessity for the structure of the script but as with all things, repitition will help me refine the process.
